/**
 * This class provides an interface for a Policy Index. Policy Indexes can be
 * implemented in whatever way they wish using any kind of backend from database
 * to filesystem as long as they adhere to this interface.

 * A Policy Index is an index over a Policy Store (see PolicyStore).
 *
 * A PolicyIndex is used by the PolicyFinder to locate matching policies.
 *
 * Policy Indexes must be kept synchronised with Policy Stores.
 *
 * See org.fcrepo.server.security.xacml.pdp.decorator.DbXmlPolicyCacheInvocationHandler
 * for synchronisation of the dbxml cache with the Fedora policy store
 *
 * If the Policy Index does not contain the complete policy documents then the implementation
 * will need to include a PolicyStore instance for retrieving the actual matching policies.
